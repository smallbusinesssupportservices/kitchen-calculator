        "bio": "Jonathan Malmin is a local builder specializing in kitchens, custom renovations, and bespoke new homes. With a passion for craftsmanship and a foundation built on trust, Jonathan and his team create spaces that foster connection and facilitate relationships. Together with a dedicated team of skilled tradespeople, they pride themselves on timely communication, efficient schedule management, and delivering projects within budget, ensuring that every project is a collaborative and rewarding experience for clients. Over the years, Jonathan has successfully completed more than 100 projects, including custom kitchen remodels, whole-home renovations, new construction builds, and larger developments such as multi-family residences and commercial properties. This diverse portfolio has prepared him to take on projects of any size or complexity, managing unique challenges and delivering tailored solutions to align with each client’s vision. Jonathan’s entrepreneurial journey began in middle school, mowing lawns for neighbors and learning the importance of punctuality, clear communication, reliability, and taking responsibility—values that remain at the heart of his work. These lessons laid the foundation for a customer-first approach, where every project is not only a construction endeavor but also an opportunity to build lasting relationships. For Jonathan, success is measured by completing each project with a stronger bond with his customers than when it began. A graduate of Georgia State University, Jonathan has been providing quality home construction services in Atlanta since 2008. Starting as a trim carpenter, he steadily expanded his skills and expertise to include all aspects of renovations and new construction. His extensive experience and passion for delivering excellence make him the ideal partner for creating homes and developments that are as functional as they are beautiful.",
